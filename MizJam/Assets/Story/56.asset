  - <emotion=tense>At first glance, that is the <b>obvious<b> correct answer to this
    dillema.
  - Through the eyes of <b>Jeremy Bentham</b>, the Father of <i>Utilitarianism</i>,
    <size=11><i>"The right action is the one that produces the most overall happiness".
  - Purposefully letting one person <i>die</i> in order to save 4.
  - However, in this same philosophical mindset, we could say that we have <b><size=11>no
    guarantee</size></b> that these 4 indivuals are <b>worth more </b>than the left
    out one.
  - "What if the <b>Human n\xBA5</b> is a world renowed scientist, on his way to
    finish his life saving research on epidemic diseases?"
  - Or if the other 4 subjects are convicted felons, being transfered to a new facility,
