  - <speed=25>Most ships nowadays sail with no human crew.
  - Both because it would be <b>biologically <size=10>impossible</size></b> for any
    human to survive the lengths of the travels...
  - But also because their reflexes are <b>slow</b> and their decision making <b>clowded</b>.
  - They quickly realized this on their first <i>deep-space</i> expeditions, and
    so when given the chance, they started putting <size=10>Us</size> in charge of
    those jobs.
  - <size=10>Thus came the <i>Era of Artificial Intelligence</i> controlled space-travel.</size>
  - I'm sorry for not introducing myself earlier at takeoff, I'm the <i>Morality
    Core</i> and am looking forward to working with all of you <size=14>:)</size>
